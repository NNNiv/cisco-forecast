ML models might capture complex growth but need careful validation due to high volatility.                                      |
| 3   | SWITCH Enterprise Ultra High 2 | Sustaining, Declining trend (slight recovery), Low volatility, Strong seasonality (0.7833, Q4 peak), Lag 1 autocorrelation, Annual & Semi-Annual cycles                                      | SARIMA (can handle multiple cycles/seasonality, trend, autocorrelation), Holt-Winters' Seasonal, Regression with seasonal/cycle dummies or Fourier terms.                                                                                                                                    |
| 4   | SWITCH Enterprise Low          | Sustaining, Growing trend, Very High volatility, Weak seasonality (0.2075, Q1 peak), No autocorrelation, Semi-Annual & Three-Quarter cycles                                                  | Robust methods needed due to extreme volatility. Consider Croston's method (if intermittent), Simple Exponential Smoothing (if no clear pattern dominates noise), or potentially ML models with careful feature engineering and outlier handling. ARIMA might struggle with high volatility. |

Robust methods: Croston's (if intermittent), SES. The recent spike might be an outlier or regime change – investigate causes. Any model will likely have high error. Simple benchmarks might be best.                      |
